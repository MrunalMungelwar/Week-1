# Air Quality Analysis in India (2015–2020)

## Overview
This project analyzes air quality data from Indian cities between 2015 and 2020. The analysis is performed in the Jupyter notebook `air_quality_analysis.ipynb` using the dataset `city_day.csv`.

## Files
- `air_quality_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code, visualizations, and analysis steps.
- `city_day.csv`: Air quality dataset (download from Kaggle and place in the same folder).

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle - Air Quality Data in India (2015–2020)
- **Description:** Contains daily air quality measurements (pollutants, AQI, city, date, etc.) for major Indian cities.

## How to Run
1. Install Python (recommended: 3.8+), Jupyter, and required libraries:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
2. Download `city_day.csv` from Kaggle and place it in this project folder.
3. Open `air_quality_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Analysis Steps
- Import libraries
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Explore data structure, summary statistics, and missing values
- Visualize AQI category distribution (if available)
- Visualize correlation heatmap for pollutants and AQI
